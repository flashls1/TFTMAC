# TFTMAC Facts

**Authority date:** 2026-09-04 America/Chicago
**Observed runtime/source evidence through:** 2026-09-04T21:55:24Z
**Purpose:** preserve facts and hard boundaries that future TFTMAC work must not casually reinterpret.

This file separates durable product facts from mutable observations and historical
results. A statement becomes a project fact only when it has direct machine,
runtime, source, SQL, or user-acceptance evidence. Requested settings are not
effective settings; presentation cadence is not Unreal FPS; a hypothesis is not a
result.

Exact benchmark formulas, automatic full-run analysis, AI-readable output
shape, and current findings live in `benchmark.md`.

## Evidence vocabulary

| Label | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **LOCKED** | Product or safety contract. Change only through an explicit, evidence-backed project decision. |
| **VERIFIED CURRENT** | Directly observed on the current Mac, installed app, source tree, or live runtime. Mutable software/version facts must retain an observation date. |
| **VERIFIED HISTORICAL** | Direct result from an earlier capture or campaign. Useful evidence, but not automatically transferable to the current M4/native runtime. |
| **USER ACCEPTED/REJECTED** | Direct usability evidence supplied by the person playing TFT. It is decisive for playability but does not by itself identify a software boundary. |
| **INFERRED** | Evidence-supported explanation that has not been observed at the claimed internal boundary. |
| **UNKNOWN** | Not measured or not validly attributable. Never silently promote this to fact. |

## 1. Host machine

| Fact | State | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Computer | **VERIFIED CURRENT:** Mac mini, model identifier `Mac16,10`, model number `MU9D3LL/A` | `system_profiler SPHardwareDataType`, 2026-08-30 |
| SoC | **VERIFIED CURRENT:** Apple M4 | `system_profiler` |
| CPU topology | **VERIFIED CURRENT:** 10 physical/logical cores: 4 performance and 6 efficiency | `system_profiler`; `sysctl hw.physicalcpu`, `hw.perflevel*` |
| GPU | **VERIFIED CURRENT:** integrated Apple M4 GPU, 10 cores, Metal supported | `system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType` |
| Unified memory | **VERIFIED CURRENT:** 16 GB; exact `hw.memsize` is 17,179,869,184 bytes | `system_profiler`; `sysctl hw.memsize` |
| CPU/GPU clock | **VERIFIED CURRENT BOUNDARY:** this Mac does not expose a fixed project-controlled CPU or GPU MHz value through the audited `system_profiler`/`sysctl` fields. Frequency is not a TFTMAC emulator knob. Do not invent an 800 MHz or 1600 MHz virtual-GPU fact. | Live host audit |
| Power | **VERIFIED CURRENT at audit:** AC power | `pmset -g batt` |
| Thermal/power warnings | **VERIFIED CURRENT at audit:** no thermal, performance, or CPU-power warning had been recorded | `pmset -g therm` |
| macOS | **VERIFIED CURRENT:** macOS 26.6.2, build 25G83; Darwin 25.6.0 | `sw_vers`; `system_profiler` |
| Architecture | **VERIFIED CURRENT:** arm64 | Xcode/Swift target and stack lock |
| Xcode | **VERIFIED CURRENT:** Xcode 26.6, build 17F113, authoritative path `/Applications/Xcode-26.6.0.app/Contents/Developer` | `xcodebuild -version`; `ssot/STACK.lock.yaml` |
| Swift | **VERIFIED CURRENT:** Apple Swift 6.3.3, arm64 macOS target | `swift --version` |

The current Mac is not the same host as the older M1 Max performance campaign.
Historical M1 Max results remain valid for their recorded environment, but they
must never be presented as measurements of this M4 Mac mini.

## 2. Product identity and user experience

- **LOCKED:** TFTMAC is its own native macOS application. It is not a Clara app,
  does not ship through Node, and does not depend on a Clara service to play.
- **LOCKED:** the application uses AppKit window behavior, a native Metal-backed
  display, normal macOS menus and window controls, and native macOS fullscreen.
- **LOCKED:** the Android Emulator's Qt window stays hidden in normal operation.
- **LOCKED:** the complete Android display is shown aspect-correctly. The normal
  guest/output target is 1920×1080; a 16:9 fullscreen content region is filled.
- **LOCKED:** no scrcpy or encoded-video path is the production display path.
- **VERIFIED CURRENT:** bundle identifier `com.flashls1.tftmac`.
- **VERIFIED CURRENT:** installed release `/Applications/TFTMAC.app`, version
  2.3.0, build 8, arm64. Capture
  `2026-08-31T21-39-18.396Z-fe34e3a1-fb91-44eb-804f-4ca8519dfc31`
  directly proves authorized ADB, official TFT PID observation, exact
  `GameActivity` SurfaceView selection, automatic graphics-run admission,
  `COMPLETE` stack receipts, and frame-to-run/hash/window/receipt linkage.
- **VERIFIED CURRENT:** `/Users/flash/Desktop/TFTMAC.app` points to the signed
  `/Applications/TFTMAC Control Launcher.app`, which launches the unchanged
  `/Applications/TFTMAC.app` and may unlock only `emulator-5582`. Direct launch
  of `/Applications/TFTMAC.app` remains the rollback.
- **VERIFIED CURRENT:** `LSSupportsGameMode=true` is present in the installed
  bundle. This establishes Game Mode eligibility, not proof that macOS activated
  it during a particular match.
- **VERIFIED CURRENT:** the official full-bleed penguin-samurai icon is embedded.
  The source, 1024-pixel output, and ICNS hashes are frozen in
  `ssot/runtime-authority.json`.
- **VERIFIED HISTORICAL RELEASE ACCEPTANCE:** Build 8 was signed with the local
  `TFTMAC Local Code Signing` identity and passed deep/strict verification when
  the release receipt was created. It is not notarized for public distribution.
- **VERIFIED TIMESTAMPED HOST AUDIT (2026-08-31T23:13:30Z):** the installed TFTMAC
  executable and emulator-host hashes still match that Build 8 receipt, but the
  login keychain now exposes zero valid code-signing identities and
  `codesign --verify --deep --strict` fails with `CSSMERR_TP_NOT_TRUSTED`.
  Current-host installed-runtime verification was therefore blocked until the
  local identity was repaired. The later 2026-09-02 recheck records two valid
  identities and deep/strict verification PASS for both installed apps. Neither
  observation rewrites the historical release acceptance result.

### 2.1 Development / release-promotion doctrine

- **LOCKED USER POLICY:** `/Applications/TFTMAC.app` is the protected stable **Control** launcher/runtime. Normal engineering work must not rebuild, patch, overwrite, replace, or install development artifacts over this app.
- **LOCKED USER POLICY:** active feature development targets the isolated **DEV / `advanced_diagnostics`** product at `/Applications/TFTMAC DEV.app`, bundle `com.flashls1.tftmac.dev`, with its separate AVD, ports, state, captures, and launcher.
- **LOCKED USER POLICY:** Control exists as the always-available known-good rollback/playable launcher while DEV changes are being developed and validated.
- **LOCKED USER POLICY:** moving accepted DEV functionality into a full production release is a separate, explicit release-promotion operation. Until Flash explicitly authorizes that promotion and its acceptance gates pass, DEV work must not mutate the installed Control artifact.
- **LOCKED:** build/install scripts and agent workflows must fail closed if a DEV operation would overwrite or drift the protected Control executable, emulator-host identity, AVD, ports, or launcher.
- **OPERATIONAL NOTE:** because Control and DEV use an exclusive runtime lease, one may need to be cleanly closed before the other launches; this does not authorize changing the Control artifact or configuration.

## 3. Launch and ADB architecture

- **LOCKED:** launch the emulator through the packaged `TFTMAC Emulator Host.app`
  in the logged-in user's macOS session:

  ```text
  /usr/bin/open -n -W --env ... --args ...
  ```

- **LOCKED:** do not replace that host chain with direct Node/Clara `spawn()`.
  The discarded direct-service path changed the ADB execution/session identity
  and produced an unauthorized guest.
- **LOCKED:** ADB server port `5038`; emulator console port `5582`; serial
  `emulator-5582`.
- **LOCKED:** do not inject `ADB_VENDOR_KEYS`. The launcher uses the logged-in
  user's established ADB identity. Build 8 passes empty `ADB_SERVER_SOCKET` and
  `ANDROID_ADB_SERVER_ADDRESS` values through `/usr/bin/open`; its packaged
  `RuntimeHost/main.c` does not yet remove those variables before `execv`.
- **VERIFIED HISTORICAL ROOT CAUSE:** the incorrect direct path used `5040`,
  `5592`, and `emulator-5592`, leading to `unauthorized` and eventually
  `Timed out waiting for emulator ADB device.` The Android runtime, AVD, GPU,
  RAM, CPU, and proven host launcher were not the cause of that failure.
- **LOCKED:** authenticated EmulatorController is loopback-only, discovered from
  the launched emulator's PID-bound registration, and authenticated with a token
  held only in memory.
- **VERIFIED CURRENT:** controller port request `8554`; emulator option
  `-grpc-use-token`; raw controller frame limit raised to 16 MiB because a
  1920×1080 RGBA frame is 8,294,400 bytes and exceeds gRPC's former 4 MiB
  default.

## 4. Android runtime and official package

| Item | Current authority |
| --- | --- |
| Runtime root | `/Volumes/MAC MINI M4/TFTMAC/Runtime` |
| SDK root | `/Volumes/MAC MINI M4/TFTMAC/Runtime/SDK` |
| Emulator | Android Emulator 37.1.11.0, build 15917651 |
| AVD | `TFT_Ultra_Tablet` |
| Guest | Official Google Play ARM64 system image, API 36, image revision 7 |
| Platform tools | 37.0.1 |
| WebView provider | `com.google.android.webview` |
| WebView version observed | 151.0.7922.199 |
| TFT package | `com.riotgames.league.teamfighttactics` |
| TFT version observed | `18.1-5402721`, version code `8402721` |
| Installer authority | `com.android.vending` / Google Play |
| Unreal activity | `com.epicgames.unreal.GameActivity` |
| Riot login activity | `com.riotgames.platformui.mobilefre.MobileFREWebViewActivity` |

- **LOCKED USER FACT:** current TFT uses Unreal Engine. Engineering work must
  reason about the current Unreal-based client, not the retired legacy engine.
- **LOCKED USER PREMISE:** the former native Mac path no longer supplies the
  current playable client after the engine transition; TFTMAC exists to present
  the official Android Unreal client as a native Mac experience.
- **LOCKED:** Google Play owns install/update delivery; Riot owns authentication,
  game content, and the signed TFT package.
- **LOCKED:** do not mirror, modify, patch, inject into, re-sign, or privately
  distribute Riot's APK or signed assets.
- **LOCKED:** Riot credentials, Google credentials, CAPTCHA, MFA, and consent are
  entered manually in the official UI. Do not log or automate them.
- **MUTABLE:** package and WebView versions can change through their official
  stores. Every session must record what was actually installed.
- **UNKNOWN:** the TFT signer digest has been observed in Android package output,
  but has not yet been promoted as a durable project-authority digest.

## 5. Current graphics and audio pipeline

```text
TFT Unreal direct-Vulkan workload
  -> guest Vulkan command stream
  -> gfxstream over virtio-gpu ASG
  -> MoltenVK Vulkan-to-Metal translation
  -> Apple Metal / M4 GPU
  -> Android SurfaceFlinger actual presentation
  -> authenticated raw RGBA frame stream
  -> TFTMAC Metal presenter
  -> native macOS fullscreen window
```

Boundary rules:

- Unreal owns game simulation, effects, render-thread/RHI workload, and the
  game's actual frame production.
- **VERIFIED CURRENT PATH:** the latest stack receipt identifies
  `UNREAL_ENGINE_VULKAN`. ANGLE may be present for another guest/package path,
  but is not assumed to render TFT unless a per-run receipt proves it.
- ANGLE owns GLES-to-Vulkan translation only when a game selects GLES/EGL and
  Android selects ANGLE for that package. Its ES 3.2 exposure is a compatibility
  route, not general conformance proof.
- gfxstream/ASG owns guest-to-host graphics command transport. Configured ring,
  buffer, and flush values do not prove per-frame transport latency.
- MoltenVK owns host Vulkan-to-Metal translation. Environment values are
  requested values unless effective behavior is directly measured.
- TFTMAC owns host launch/session control, the final completed-frame copy,
  orientation/scaling, native input mapping, output cadence, and local evidence.
- Two different components use Metal: MoltenVK for emulated Vulkan work and
  TFTMAC for final image presentation. A fast final presenter does not prove the
  upstream game/transport pipeline is fast.

## 6. Proven Control profile

The current control is the following complete configuration. Change one
declared test factor at a time; do not silently mix profiles.

| Variable | Control |
| --- | --- |
| Profile | `tftmac_5gb_native_v1` |
| Guest display | 1920×1080 |
| Density | 320 dpi |
| Refresh target | 60 Hz |
| vCPU | 6 |
| Guest RAM | 5120 MiB |
| GPU | host |
| Audio | CoreAudio |
| Transport | `virtio-gpu-asg` |
| ASG write buffer | 1,048,576 bytes / 1 MiB |
| ASG write step | 16,384 bytes / 16 KiB |
| ASG data ring | 32,768 bytes / 32 KiB |
| ASG draw flush | 800 microseconds |
| Emulator features | `GLESDynamicVersion,Vulkan,GuestAngle,-GLPipeChecksum,VulkanBatchedDescriptorSetUpdate,AsyncComposeSupport,VirtioGpuFenceContexts` |
| ANGLE enabled | `exposeNonConformantExtensionsAndVersions:exposeES32ForTesting` |
| ANGLE disabled | `preferSubmitAtFBOBoundary` |
| MoltenVK synchronous submits | 0 / disabled |
| MoltenVK max active command buffers | 64 |
| MoltenVK fast math | 1 / enabled |
| TFT graphics | High |
| TFT FPS cap | 60 |
| Riot Performance Mode Beta | OFF |

The current settings UI safely exposes only:

- vCPU: 4, 6, 8;
- guest RAM: 4096, 5120, 6144 MiB;
- refresh target: 30 or 60 Hz;
- ASG draw flush: 400 or 800 microseconds;
- named experiment: Control or Combat Latency A.

The existence of a UI choice does not mean it is faster. All restart-bound
values require a clean, logged relaunch.

## 7. Native input, login, power, and audio

- **VERIFIED CURRENT:** Mac primary-button down/drag/up maps to Android
  EmulatorController `TouchEvent`, identifier `0`, non-zero contact pressure,
  and explicit zero-pressure release. Desktop mouse events are not the primary
  touch path.
- **VERIFIED CURRENT:** keyboard input uses EmulatorController `sendKey`.
  SQLite stores character count and special-key name only, never typed text.
- **VERIFIED HISTORICAL:** the Riot login form expects the private Riot account
  username, not an email address and not the public `Name#Tag` Riot ID.
- **VERIFIED CURRENT RISK:** Riot's WebView can ANR on input dispatch. The narrow
  proven recovery keeps TFTMAC and the emulator alive, restores
  `show_ime_with_hard_keyboard=0`, restarts only Riot's failed process, and
  reopens the official activity. This is recovery evidence, not proof that the
  mutable WebView/IME defect can never recur.
- **LOCKED:** secure Android PIN unlock stays manual. TFTMAC may record that
  unlock is required, but never the PIN or typed content.
- **VERIFIED CURRENT:** Build 7 establishes virtual AC power, Android stay-awake
  state, and `mWakefulness=Awake` before unlock/gameplay. It logs
  `GUEST_GAMEPLAY_POWER_READY` or fails clearly.
- **VERIFIED CURRENT:** emulator requests `-audio coreaudio`; prior live evidence
  observed active 48 kHz stereo output and no partial/empty underruns.
- **UNKNOWN/USER ACCEPTANCE:** software audio health does not prove the user can
  hear sound at their selected speakers/headphones.

## 8. Frame-rate truth

The on-screen overlay labels two host-facing rates:

```text
SRC <distinct source-image rate> · OUT <native Metal presentation rate>
```

- `SRC` is distinct authenticated gRPC images received per second.
- `OUT` is TFTMAC Metal presentation cadence.
- Neither is automatically Unreal gameplay FPS.
- A repeated/static image can be presented at 60 OUT while TFT produces fewer
  useful frames.
- `dumpsys gfxinfo` is not authoritative for TFT's native Unreal/Vulkan
  SurfaceView.
- Player-visible game-frame authority is the exact TFT SurfaceFlinger layer's
  actual-present timestamps, summarized into one-second windows.
- p95, p99, maximum interval, 1% low, jank, severe stalls, repeated images, and
  visible-stutter markers matter more than a flattering average.

## 9. Logging and SQL authority

Every app launch creates a private mode-0700 capture directory:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/TFTMAC/Captures/<session-id>/
  TFTMAC_NATIVE_RUNTIME.sqlite
  native-events.jsonl
  emulator.stdout.log
  emulator.stderr.log
  logcat.raw.txt
  bounded diagnostic artifacts
```

Persistent normalized comparison authority:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/TFTMAC/TFTMAC_LAB.sqlite
```

The implemented “SQL logging system” is local SQLite. It is not a MySQL server
and does not require a network database service.

The session database is raw query authority. The persistent lab links raw
captures by session/configuration/artifact identity rather than duplicating
credential-bearing or full raw data.

| SQL table | Fact represented | Normal cadence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sessions` | session start/end/status/profile | boundary |
| `runtime_receipts` | requested/effective launch, package, ports, renderer, profile | startup and receipts |
| `events` | lifecycle, ADB, package, markers, failures, process/layer changes | event-driven |
| `frame_samples` | bounded image/hash/dimension/sequence checkpoints | boundary/checkpoint |
| `frame_interval_windows` | source ingress intervals/drops | 1 second |
| `presentation_samples` | labeled SRC/OUT/mailbox behavior | about 1 second |
| `game_frame_intervals` | exact TFT actual-present intervals and flags | each observed guest frame |
| `game_frame_windows` | FPS, 1% low, p50/p95/p99/max, jank/severe/misses | 1 second |
| `stream_freshness_windows` | changed/repeated frames and transport loss | 1 second |
| `host_presentation_windows` | final Metal submissions/completions/GPU time/errors | 1 second |
| `resource_samples` | QEMU CPU/RSS, TFT PID/activity | 5 seconds |
| `guest_memory_samples` | guest memory and swap | 5 seconds |
| `host_resource_samples` | host memory pressure, thermal, power source | 5 seconds |
| `clock_sync_samples` | host/guest midpoint and round-trip error | 30 seconds |
| `surfaceflinger_samples` | render rate and cumulative miss counters | boundaries and 30 seconds |
| `audio_samples` | audio output/rate/stereo/tracks/underruns | boundaries and 30 seconds |
| `logcat_aggregates` | ANR/fatal/LMK/renderer/audio counts | 5 seconds |
| `pipeline_log_aggregates` | gfxstream/ASG/Vulkan/MoltenVK/shader/fence counts | 5 seconds |
| `graphics_pipeline_snapshots` | effective layer and graphics identities | 30 seconds |
| `graphics_runs` | automatic TFT process/layer lifetime, configuration SHA, target FPS, start/end reason | process/layer lifecycle |
| `graphics_pipeline_incidents` | automatic exact-layer degradation and conservative causal unknowns | bounded incident |
| `diagnostic_artifacts` | trace path/hash/processor/normalization status | event-driven |
| `combat_benchmarks` | complete benchmark configuration, coverage, validity, metrics | benchmark end |
| `combat_incidents` | trigger metrics, trace link, first divergent boundary/unknowns | incident |
| `combat_comparisons` | control/candidate deltas and decision | comparison |
| `game_process_sessions` | TFT PID lifetime | process transition |
| `input_samples` | touch metadata and keyboard counts only | each input event |

- **VERIFIED CURRENT:** base graphics logging opens automatically from the
  observed TFT process/layer and seals only at process/app close. It is
  independent of match markers, Combat Benchmark controls, and battle
  classification.
- **VERIFIED CURRENT:** stack receipts, SHA-256, `graphics_run_id`, and exact
  interval/window joins are written continuously. They prove scope and receipt
  integrity, not internal causal ownership.
- **LOCKED:** the final native Mac presenter remains a hidden correctness
  receipt. It is not displayed, ranked, or selected as a graphics root cause.
- **UNKNOWN / PLANNED:** no shared work ID or source-site span currently crosses
  guest submit, ASG/gfxstream, host Vulkan, MoltenVK, and Metal. The current
  logger cannot identify an internal root; advanced causal instrumentation is
  planned in an isolated diagnostic runtime.

Privacy facts:

- Raw logcat and raw traces are sensitive local sidecars and are not pasted or
  published without deliberate sanitization.
- No screenshot, raw frame payload, username, password, email, token, cookie,
  PIN, CAPTCHA, MFA value, or typed content belongs in SQL or project history.
- No remote telemetry service is required.

## 10. Benchmark contract

- **LOCKED:** complete automatic TFT process/layer runs are preferred
  product-performance evidence. Every logged frame and resource/pipeline sample
  inside the lifecycle participates; match/combat markers and classifiers are
  optional annotations only.
- **LOCKED:** the current UI/source-named Combat Benchmark remains a faster
  5–8 minute bounded A/B screen; it does not gate base graphics logging or
  replace a full-run promotion check.
- **LOCKED:** graphics optimization decisions use graphics cadence and boundary
  evidence. CPU/RAM/audio observations remain health/correctness context only;
  this effort does not optimize them.
- **LOCKED:** the product target is useful-frame cadence of at least 60 FPS
  throughout the complete run, not a flattering average or selected scene.
- **LOCKED:** `benchmark.md` is the formula and reporting authority. Historical
  `docs/benchmarks.md` results retain their original M1 Max/userdebug scope.

- Start the bounded A/B during representative continuous gameplay; no semantic
  phase marker is required.
- Minimum valid combat duration: 300 seconds.
- Automatic close: 480 seconds.
- Exact TFT layer/timestamp availability: at least 95%.
- Clock coverage: at least 95%.
- p95 clock RTT at or below 2 ms permits precise cross-boundary attribution;
  2–10 ms permits coarse ordering; above 10 ms means cross-host cause UNKNOWN.
- Start trace: one bounded 20-second, 32-MiB Perfetto trace.
- Incident traces: at most two 15-second, 32-MiB traces.
- Automatic incident trigger: two adjacent one-second windows with 1% low below
  30 FPS, p99 at least 50 ms, or severe stalls.
- Trace cooldown: 120 seconds; no concurrent traces.
- If trace-active versus trace-inactive windows differ by more than 5%, retain
  performance data but mark trace causality `OBSERVER_OVERHEAD_INVALID`.
- Valid traces are SHA-256 sealed and normalized by pinned
  `trace_processor_shell` v58.2. Pinned SHA-256:
  `d29864d1ba3b36855527bb1b0ca3aa7f703cdce338b9680bb922c5c151b358fa`.

Decision rules:

- **HOME_RUN:** after the weighted-FPS +5% guard, 1% low +20% or more, jank and
  severe rates each -30% or more relative, and either weighted FPS +10% or p95
  interval -15%.
- **PROMISING:** weighted FPS +5% or more and 1% low +10% or more, with no
  correctness or tail regression.
- **REJECT:** gain below 5%, p95/p99 worsens at least 10%, or any boot, render,
  input, audio, login, memory, cleanup, or usability regression.
- **INCONCLUSIVE:** invalid workload/coverage/synchronization, incompatible
  configuration identity, or result between thresholds.
- A winning candidate still requires a five-minute cold confirmation before
  normal-use promotion.
- **LOCKED:** `HOME_RUN`/`PROMISING` are relative candidate decisions, not proof
  that the product target is met. The separate full-run status remains
  `TARGET_NOT_MET` until useful-frame cadence holds at least 60 FPS throughout.

## 11. Verified results and decisions

### Current native/runtime evidence

- **VERIFIED CURRENT:** automatic capture
  `2026-08-31T22-30-26.086Z-8df607d7-a34a-4e2a-b00d-739aa3143200` recorded an
  uninterrupted 42m27s TFT graphics run (PID 2774) with 144,364 exact
  SurfaceFlinger intervals, 99.629% exact-layer coverage, and 189 degradation
  incidents. Weighted FPS was 56.98, 1% low 21.49 FPS, p95 21.510 ms, p99
  33.434 ms, and 53.72% of intervals missed the 60-FPS budget.
- **VERIFIED CURRENT BOUNDARY:** final native presentation remained near 60 Hz
  during this run, so it is retained only as hidden correctness context. The
  first internal graphics boundary remains `UNKNOWN`; present evidence localizes
  lateness upstream of or at the exact TFT SurfaceFlinger layer.

### 2026-09-02 live severe-slowdown capture

- **VERIFIED CURRENT CAPTURE:**
  `2026-09-02T05-26-14.078Z-0fb7a877-23f7-4933-bc9f-5525ed8c6d3d` is retained
  as the user's severe-slowdown run. The sealed SQLite authority is 18,583,552
  bytes with SHA-256
  `2246edff4f433cd5a6d8d995a612274930d2ad979fa649f9249b690fe6f3ed8b`.
- **VERIFIED PERFORMANCE:** the final 300-second tail contains 213 exact-layer
  windows. Mean effective FPS was 15.884, the worst window was 0.684 FPS, mean
  1% low was 10.081 FPS, and the windows accumulated 13,494 missed-vsync
  equivalents. This is direct evidence of unacceptable sustained frame loss.
- **VERIFIED PIPELINE CONTEXT:** stream delivery averaged approximately 15 FPS
  with no sequence loss while the final Mac presenter continued its established
  near-60-Hz correctness cadence. The useful-frame deficit therefore existed
  before the final presenter; the final presenter is not a selectable root-cause
  candidate.
- **VERIFIED CPU ASSIGNMENT:** guest CPUs `0-5` were online and present and the
  guest reported six processors. The slowdown was not caused by TFTMAC assigning
  only two guest vCPUs.
- **VERIFIED TRACE SIGNAL:** in the second bounded Perfetto trace, Unreal's
  `RHIThread` was scheduled running for 13.38 seconds of an approximately
  14.7-second trace (91.3%) and runnable-but-not-running for only 1.6%.
  `SwappyThread3`, `GameThread`, and `RenderThread` were scheduled running for
  approximately 40.2%, 24.6%, and 11.4% of the trace. This is the strongest
  current signal of serialized pressure in the guest Unreal RHI/Vulkan path;
  it does not by itself prove which owned gfxstream/MoltenVK boundary must be
  changed.
- **VERIFIED GUEST WARNINGS:** the run logged
  `VIRTGPU_PARAM_CREATE_FENCE_PASSING` unavailable 26 times, nine
  `DRM_IOCTL_VIRTGPU_GET_CAPS` invalid-argument failures, and nine
  `DRM_IOCTL_VIRTGPU_CONTEXT_INIT` file-exists fallbacks. These remain causal
  suspects, not proven owners.
- **VERIFIED HOST CHURN:** `emulator.stdout.log` contains 307 internal emulator
  helper ADB failures with `cannot start server on remote host`, while TFTMAC's
  primary ADB server remained authorized on 5038. Empty inherited ADB endpoint
  variables are a source-level defect to repair, but this background churn is
  not yet proven to explain the frame collapse.
- **VERIFIED ARTIFACTS:** two bounded traces and their normalized JSON/CSV
  receipts are retained under the capture's `perfetto/` directory. They are
  private diagnostic evidence and must not enter Git.
- **USER ACCEPTANCE:** this run was reported as too slow for enjoyable play. It
  is a retained regression/problem record, not a promotable configuration.

### 2026-09-02 restored play authority

- **VERIFIED CURRENT LAUNCH:** capture
  `2026-09-02T05-54-33.919Z-e13fd9b8-1091-4516-bd6e-66f8b50a912d` passed the
  exclusive-runtime preflight, launched through the packaged Mac host, authorized
  ADB on 5038 / `emulator-5582`, and produced a 1920x1080 first native frame.
- **VERIFIED CURRENT SETTINGS:** preset `control`, six vCPU, 5120 MiB RAM,
  1920x1080 at 320 dpi and 60 Hz. This is the normal-play authority restored for
  the user's game; do not restart or replace it during live play.
- **VERIFIED CONTROL RESULT:** graphics run
  `3ebd80ab-5f0f-489e-97ae-d9e0d780831a` retained 14,348 exact TFT frame
  intervals across 353.5 seconds: 47.384 weighted FPS, 7.870 FPS 1% low,
  16.868/34.002/50.492 ms p50/p95/p99, 19.090% jank, 1.429% severe stalls,
  and 3,820 missed-vsync equivalents.
- **VERIFIED REJECTION:** the preceding severe run retained 35,424 intervals
  across 1,355.8 seconds: 26.446 weighted FPS, 2.770 FPS 1% low,
  16.975/117.088/218.054 ms p50/p95/p99, 34.714% jank, 21.037% severe stalls,
  and 44,922 missed-vsync equivalents. Control was decisively more usable, so
  `combat_latency_a` is rejected for normal play. The workloads were not a
  formal matched A/B pair, so the QoS request alone is not claimed as the cause.

### 2026-09-02 Control and DEV launcher separation

- **LOCKED CONTROL:** `/Applications/TFTMAC.app` remains the protected normal-play
  app with bundle ID `com.flashls1.tftmac`. Its executable SHA-256 remains
  `d3bf7c249a3e5f11b81f778b063e1a8cfe2e7fdeec0537ee6bd8447b1c2268d2`,
  and its packaged emulator-host SHA-256 remains
  `ea028ec1d74cc025638c2a0e5f8c783748803c1b0ba9012962c038251fb3eb63`.
  The protected app remains directly launchable as rollback. The Desktop icon
  points to the separate signed Control unlock wrapper and retains the official
  Control artwork.
- **VERIFIED DEV INSTALL:** `/Applications/TFTMAC DEV.app` is a separately
  signed native app with bundle ID `com.flashls1.tftmac.dev` and a distinct
  generated DEV icon. `/Users/flash/Desktop/TFTMAC DEV.app` points to it.
- **LOCKED ISOLATION:** DEV selects `advanced_diagnostics`, uses state namespace
  `advanced_diagnostics`, ADB/console/controller ports `5041/5586/8556`, serial
  `emulator-5586`, and AVD `TFTMAC_Diagnostic_StockShadow_R1`. Control continues to
  use its original application-support root, ports `5038/5582/8554`, serial
  `emulator-5582`, and AVD `TFT_Ultra_Tablet`. The global runtime lease forbids
  either launcher from starting while the other owns the runtime.
- **VERIFIED CURRENT SIGNING:** both installed app bundles pass strict deep
  `codesign` verification with the local `TFTMAC Local Code Signing` identity.
  The current keychain exposes that identity and the Apple Development identity;
  `scripts/verify-installed-runtime.command` also passes for Control.
- **VERIFIED CURRENT:** the stock-shadow DEV runtime physically clones Emulator
  37.1.11 and the API 36 Control AVD into the diagnostic root. Its sealed receipt
  state is `STOCK_SHADOW_RUNTIME_IDENTITY_PASS`; the Control AVD tree hash
  remained unchanged before and after cloning.
- **VERIFIED CURRENT:** three consecutive stock-shadow DEV launches reached ADB
  `device`, awake/unlocked Android, authenticated controller, exact native first
  frame, official TFT package/layer, input/audio receipts, and clean shutdown:
  `2026-09-02T12-16-42.125Z-c46f...`,
  `2026-09-02T12-18-11.819Z-1300...`, and
  `2026-09-02T12-19-13.294Z-3d6d...`.
- **BOUNDARY:** Control is the dependable playable launcher. DEV stock shadow is
  launch/play compatible for isolated diagnostics but can never replace Control.

- **VERIFIED CURRENT:** Build 7 live capture
  `2026-08-31T02-54-28.329Z-14000b50-bf29-44c6-a963-9203d5313494`
  reached authenticated ADB, a 1920×1080 RGBA first frame, awake/stay-on guest
  power, logger health, official TFT package receipt, and
  `TFT_READY_FOR_USER` under `combat_latency_a`.
- **VERIFIED CURRENT:** configuration SHA-256
  `05039d1fd0987f46fc7da8de5f483d8c7ffaf8f39bd1eaecdd1aee11603bbb07`.
- **VERIFIED CURRENT:** host pre-exec QoS request returned 0 and read back
  `user_interactive`, relative priority 0.
- **UNKNOWN:** this does not prove every QEMU worker inherited that scheduling
  class or that combat performance improved.
- **VERIFIED CURRENT:** the same live session recorded Riot WebView/input ANR
  aggregates and a narrow Riot-only recovery. Do not misclassify that as a
  graphics improvement or as a whole-emulator crash.
- **VERIFIED CURRENT:** the user marked one complete Build 7 match in that same
  session from event 1442 at `2026-08-31T03:19:25Z` through event 3065 at
  `2026-08-31T03:51:00Z`, a 1,895.054-second / 31m35.054s range.
- **VERIFIED CURRENT:** the marked run contains 93,724 exact TFT
  actual-present intervals: weighted FPS 49.449, 1% low 16.300 FPS, p95
  33.822 ms, p99 48.746 ms, maximum 1,254.162 ms, 19.110% jank, and 0.610%
  severe intervals. Exact-layer measured coverage was 100%, with one stable
  layer and no history truncation.
- **VERIFIED CURRENT:** 58,925 intervals (62.871%) exceeded the 60 FPS frame
  budget; total budget overrun was 357,921.976 ms; the longest consecutive
  budget-miss run was 325 intervals; and 1,599 of 1,693 complete one-second
  windows (94.448%) were below 60 FPS.
- **VERIFIED CURRENT:** final TFTMAC Metal output averaged 59.968 FPS with zero
  drawable/command errors and maximum recorded final-presenter GPU time
  3.267 ms, while 23,231 presentations reused a source frame. This makes the
  final pass a poor explanation for the missing useful frames in this match; it
  does not identify which upstream component was first late.
- **UNKNOWN:** this full run is not a candidate-vs-Control decision. It has no
  matched Control/formal benchmark row, and p95 clock RTT was 86.757 ms, so
  cross-host ownership is invalid. `benchmark.md` preserves the complete result.

### Rejected Home Run A / Riot Performance Mode Beta

- **USER REJECTED:** worst gameplay/graphics experience; do not select again.
- **VERIFIED HISTORICAL:** 480.646 seconds; weighted FPS 56.665; 1% low 17.698;
  p95 21.760 ms; p99 34.335 ms; maximum frame 517.488 ms; jank rate 4.554%;
  severe rate 0.290%.
- **VERIFIED HISTORICAL:** incident 1% lows 1.932 and 4.629 FPS; one incident
  included a 517.488 ms p99/max interval.
- **INVALID FOR CAUSAL ATTRIBUTION:** p95 clock RTT 87.318 ms and observer
  overhead invalidated cross-boundary ownership claims.
- **LOCKED DECISION:** `home_run_a` remains only as a historical migration/raw
  receipt enum. It is not selectable. Riot Performance Mode Beta stays OFF.

### Earlier fixed-stage graphics campaign

These are **VERIFIED HISTORICAL** results from a different M1 Max/userdebug
campaign, useful for candidate selection but not current M4 runtime performance:

- ASG versus pipe at exact stage 1-1: 40.1 FPS / 34.85 ms p95 versus
  29.6 FPS / 49.75 ms p95. ASG selected.
- Three controls at Trial 1-2/1-5/1-8: 40.60 / 36.03 / 27.83 FPS.
- Confirmed 67% effects/LOD profile: 45.20 / 38.50 / 33.80 FPS; stage-1-8
  p95 35.07–35.95 ms.
- 16 KiB ASG write step beat paired 4 KiB control and was retained.
- 2560×1440 versus 1600×900 changed a controlled stage-1-5 result only from
  30.5 to 31.3 FPS despite 2.56× source pixels, indicating that scene was not
  primarily pixel-fill bound.
- The historical selected stack did not achieve the 57 FPS heavy-scene goal and
  did not reproduce the user's worst approximately 15 FPS gameplay period.

### Graphics council and ZoeMC simulation

- **VERIFIED HISTORICAL:** specialist research covered Unreal, ANGLE, gfxstream/
  ASG, MoltenVK, Metal, and transferable Fortnite/Unreal measurement categories.
- **VERIFIED HISTORICAL:** the 10,000-world ZoeMC v0.2 run used declared
  subjective priors. It is hypothesis-ordering evidence, not empirical proof.
- **RESOLVED BRANCH:** the simulation's decisive next test—authenticated native
  frame delivery—was completed. Raw authenticated gRPC is viable for correct
  1920×1080 native presentation and input.
- **NOT PROMOTED:** direct MMAP zero-copy without producer fencing, direct
  MoltenVK texture sharing without a supported contract, encoded video/scrcpy,
  and external emulator-window presentation.
- Fortnite/Unreal research can suggest counters, trace categories, pipeline-cache
  ideas, and workload hypotheses. It does not prove TFT-specific capabilities or
  justify altering Riot's signed shaders.

### Settings that must not be recycled without new causal evidence

- Pipe transport.
- MoltenVK 128/256 command buffers.
- Synchronous MoltenVK queue submission.
- Guest submit thread and broad shader prewarm.
- Native GLES and direct Vulkan routes.
- `VirtioGpuNativeSync`, `VirtioGpuNext`, disabled Vulkan descriptor batching.
- ASG 8/32 KiB write steps, 64/128 KiB rings, 512 KiB write buffer, and 2/4 ms
  flush screens.
- Active-consumer host patch.
- More guest RAM or an eighth vCPU as an assumed optimization.
- Audio disabled.
- MSAA2, material quality 1, `r.OneFrameThreadLag=0`, forced half-rate skeletal
  animation, extreme effects/LOD, blind 50% scale, and blind PSO prewarm.
- Riot Performance Mode Beta and the combined Home Run A host flags.

## 12. Retired experiment: Combat Latency A

- **LOCKED TEST SHAPE:** Control remains High/60/OFF and the complete proven
  emulator stack.
- **RETIRED CANDIDATE:** changed only the packaged emulator host's requested
  pre-exec QoS to `user_interactive`; it is not selectable for current tests.
- **VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION:** candidate/configuration hashing, stale-preset
  migration, host QoS receipt parsing, guest power gate, correctness rollback,
  and stable semantic TFT-layer comparison have native tests.
- **VERIFIED LAUNCH:** Build 7 established the requested QoS at the host
  pre-exec boundary and reached TFT ready with logging active.
- **VERIFIED REJECTION:** the user rejected the gameplay and the measured run
  was materially worse than the restored Control. It remains historical only.

## 13. Causal graphics implementation state

- **VERIFIED CURRENT:** R11 is `FAILED_FIRST_NATIVE_FRAME` historical evidence,
  not launch-ready authority. Emulator 35.6.3/API 37 cannot govern current DEV.
- **VERIFIED CURRENT:** exactly three runtime modes remain: `control`,
  `advanced_diagnostics`, and fail-closed `candidate`. Current DEV uses the
  `advanced_diagnostics` stock-shadow runtime described above.
- **VERIFIED SOURCE:** `DevExperimentProfile` seals the profile, one-factor
  feature override, effective configuration SHA-256, workload-manifest SHA-256,
  duration, warmup, and correctness requirements. The balanced campaign order
  is Control / queue-submit-inline / Control / virtual-queue-off / Control /
  fence-contexts-off / Control.
- **VERIFIED SOURCE:** the owned ARM64 Vulkan probe has five deterministic
  one-minute workloads after a 30-second warmup and no network/Riot access.
- **VERIFIED SOURCE:** the app schema contains all eight causal SQL structures.
  Swift and C++ define the same 96-byte `PipelineEventV1`; the C++ per-thread
  ring has a fixed capacity of 256 and strict owned-probe label parsing.
  Standalone ABI/parser verification passes.
- **BOUNDARY:** runtime/source hooks below the app and the seven-run campaign are
  not yet accepted evidence. No internal component is named as root until the
  label, lineage, loss, observer-overhead, and replication gates pass.

The R9/R10/R11 entries below are retained as **historical failure evidence**.
They do not override the current stock-shadow DEV authority.

- **VERIFIED HISTORICAL (2026-09-02T02:07:03Z):** Wave B source integration was
  complete under the append-only Wave B v4 correction authority. The default
  mode remains `control`, and `candidate` remains blocked.
- **VERIFIED HISTORICAL (Wave B source checkpoint):** runtime-mode registry SHA-256 was
  `136d1f8f9ac587f9ab0e839e7521b21d9c5e7a1d451d5a0bac44b44a8fe56479`.
  Runtime identity, registry/configuration hashes, AVD identity, ADB/console/
  controller ports, and serial are persisted in the exclusive lease contract.
- **VERIFIED HISTORICAL:** `scripts/verify-tftmac.command` completed with exit code
  0, produced an unsigned Release build, and passed all 49 native tests with
  zero failures. The post-verification process audit found no active TFTMAC,
  emulator, or `qemu-system-aarch64` process; no runtime, AVD, installed app, or
  official TFT package was changed or launched by Wave B.
- **VERIFIED HISTORICAL (2026-09-02T02:20:37Z):** diagnostic ADB `5041`, console
  `5586`, and controller `8556` passed listener and exclusive-bind checks with
  control stopped. A new R9 diagnostic forwarder was built from the proven
  native `RuntimeHost/main.c` chain, ad-hoc signed, deep/strict verified, and
  sealed under receipt SHA-256
  `3a0bfccbcc96466bbdb83a14a0530906ef7c37ec0e0e61b8f701b2e534e15c7f`.
  The stale first-load host remains preserved but is not R9 launch authority.
- **VERIFIED HISTORICAL:** the R9 `advanced_diagnostics` variant was selectable only through the
  explicit `TFTMAC_RUNTIME_MODE=advanced_diagnostics` environment request. Its
  R9 registry SHA-256 is
  `798bad7512da1079167b120575c5c446a1ae7a5bec3030c19fc1da817dbf206b`;
  unsigned Release and all 49 native tests pass. Control remains the default.
- **VERIFIED HISTORICAL (R9 first-boot attempt 1):** capture
  `2026-09-02T02-23-48.444Z-9a2df80c-263a-4e10-beaa-8980d095c365`
  failed before QEMU because the diagnostic registry incorrectly used the
  emulator-only R9 install directory as `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`. The forwarder and
  isolated ADB server did launch, the emulator reported `Broken AVD system
  path`, no QEMU process loaded, and the R9 AVD configuration was restored to
  its accepted SHA-256
  `090fe426402562e227a3a1a6bd6eab9f9572cd48fbe3d467c276d419860caf90`.
  The corrected registry restores the existing dedicated API 37 SDK and ADB at
  `/Volumes/MAC MINI M4/TFTMAC-RUNTIME-DATA/SDK`; source validation and all 49
  native tests passed after the correction.
- **VERIFIED HISTORICAL (R9 first-boot attempt 2):** capture
  `2026-09-02T02-31-04.642Z-c7f52368-7fd7-411d-bbf9-d6dee45eb765`
  failed before QEMU because Android Emulator 35.6.3 rejects the stock-control
  `-crash-report-mode` argument. The argument is now gated to Control; it is not
  sent to the diagnostic runtime.
- **VERIFIED HISTORICAL (R9 first-boot attempt 3):** capture
  `2026-09-02T02-33-42.154Z-d39fac1f-393f-409f-b235-5200853db209`
  loaded the R9 QEMU/gfxstream runtime but crashed in
  `protozero::MessageArena::DeleteLastMessageInternal` through
  `perfetto::TrackEvent::Initialize`, `gfxstream::host::InitializeTracing`, and
  `FrameBuffer::initialize`. Exact symbols place the first R9 blocker in the
  custom gfxstream Perfetto initialization path, not in Riot, the AVD,
  MoltenVK, Metal, ADB authorization, CPU, RAM, or audio.
- **VERIFIED HISTORICAL (R10 first boot):** capture
  `2026-09-02T03-00-38.256Z-b95cb5a2-59c6-4855-859e-846bc1deca8a`
  proved the successor passed the R9 initialization crash, loaded API 37,
  MoltenVK, selected the Apple M4 Vulkan device, enabled
  `VK_EXT_robustness2`, and initialized the OpenGL ES Translator adapter. It
  then crashed in `perfetto::protos::gen::TrackDescriptor::SerializeAsString`
  from `gfxstream::SyncThread::doSyncThreadCmd`,
  `SyncThread::initSyncEGLContext`, and `FrameBuffer::initialize`. This proves
  default-disabling `InitializeTracing` was insufficient because unguarded
  gfxstream trace-name macros still entered Perfetto.
- **VERIFIED HISTORICAL (R10 minidump adjudication):** the retained macOS 26.6.2
  arm64 minidump reports uptime `3 seconds`, `EXC_BAD_ACCESS /
  KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS` at address `0x8`, and a crashed instruction in
  `libandroid-emu-tracing.dylib + 0x749c`. Its stack carries
  `track_event`, `gfxstream.default`, and
  `libgfxstream_backend.dylib + 0x314278`; its gfxstream Mach-O UUID is
  `4C4C4449-5555-3144-A1FC-F6DFE0021481`, and its annotation reports
  `35.6.3-standalone-0`. This is the already-classified R10 Perfetto
  track-registration null dereference, not an R11 crash and not evidence
  against TFT, Riot login, the API 37 image, MoltenVK, Metal, CPU, RAM, audio,
  or the stock 37.1.11 runtime.
- **VERIFIED HISTORICAL (R11 sealed successor):** R11 kept tracing compiled but
  places the gfxstream event, instant, and name-track macros behind an explicit
  runtime opt-in. Sealed build manifest SHA-256 is
  `3fd3e18aab970728fcb94efded84952fbde0e84bce86d0ef3592184eaa1170fa`;
  gfxstream SHA-256 is
  `a770f67660c8d88f5a853b4705aefa0210ef37670a9a8df1b22b702b1f79584b`;
  runtime-configuration SHA-256 is
  `c910e13e1096da4d3ee162ed82d5658d32aee4b29d9c6af30d19447c03784560`.
  The fresh stopped `TFTMAC_Diagnostic_API37_R11` clone receipt SHA-256 is
  `e7418f81a37ad3d8169a9c1818e904f1678722e3879fcf7ee610c3257b80d419`.
- **VERIFIED HISTORICAL (R11 source/runtime gate):** registry SHA-256 is
  `b2a8080248900c27efdaac7fe3825ccb919188d43072af7a870bfc49c3e0e96f`.
  Diagnostic preflight is `READY` on isolated ports `5041/5586/8556`, and the
  official unsigned Release verifier passed all 49 native tests with zero
  failures. Control remains the default and candidate remains fail-closed.
- **VERIFIED HISTORICAL (R11 live attempt 1):** capture
  `2026-09-02T03-18-30.572Z-f4a767a5-b385-4385-bcff-7873c9cffdf9`
  reached controller discovery and `LOADED_RUNTIME_IDENTITY_PASS` for exact R11
  QEMU and gfxstream hashes. It did not crash. TFTMAC then performed an owned
  shutdown because `runController` still hard-coded the Control emulator version
  `37.1.11` and rejected the valid R11 status `35.6.3.0
  (35.6.3-standalone-0)`. The check is now mode-aware and consumes the sealed
  `expected_emulator_version_contains` authority (`35.6.3` for R11); the
  regression assertion is included in the existing 49-test suite.
- **VERIFIED HISTORICAL (R11 corrected live attempt):** capture
  `2026-09-02T03-27-32.017Z-80c1dff8-30cf-4f3d-984f-2a3c37863de6`
  passed controller authentication and exact R11 loaded-runtime identity. The
  R9/R10 Perfetto crash did not recur. ADB changed from `offline` to
  `unauthorized` using the logged-in user's default key and no
  `ADB_VENDOR_KEYS`; no native first frame arrived before the bounded 120-second
  gate. The emulator explicitly reported that the API 37 guest requires a host
  supporting `QemuCameraSensorOrientation` and `VulkanVirtualQueue`. The owned
  shutdown restored the diagnostic AVD configuration.
- **VERIFIED HISTORICAL (R11 wake-control retry):** capture
  `2026-09-02T03-33-05.318Z-d463ced7-5843-4a11-8c95-c9757c7ee032`
  repeated exact R11 identity/controller passes and sent `Power` immediately
  after authentication. It again produced no first frame and ADB remained
  unauthorized. This rejects a wake-command timing explanation; repeating the
  same R11 runtime is not an eligible next experiment.
- **VERIFIED HISTORICAL (R11 ADB provisioning and isolated DEV launch):** the
  existing logged-in-user ADB identity was approved once inside the isolated
  DEV AVD; no `ADB_VENDOR_KEYS` injection or authorization bypass remains in
  the runtime profile. Final DEV capture
  `2026-09-02T07-46-40.998Z-8260f517-a8a4-4d5e-918f-723b81de32f4`
  passed ownership preflight, exact R11 loaded-runtime identity, and ADB state
  `device`. Automatic session/database logging started in the isolated DEV
  application-support namespace.
- **VERIFIED HISTORICAL (R11 first-frame failure after ADB repair):** that same
  capture never emitted `FIRST_NATIVE_FRAME` and recorded `RUNTIME_FAILED` at
  `2026-09-02T07:48:46Z` with `Timed out waiting for Android to post its first
  native frame.` The 120-second gate therefore proves the launcher and ADB
  authorization are no longer the blocking boundary; the custom R11/API 37
  rendering path still fails before native frame delivery. DEV was shut down
  cleanly after preserving this evidence.
- **VERIFIED HISTORICAL (hybrid compatibility probe):** substituting the R11
  gfxstream backend into an isolated APFS clone of the stock 37.1.11 host failed
  to load because stock `libemugl_common.dylib` does not export the actively
  required `g_emugl_dma_get_host_addr` symbol. Substituting the paired R11
  `libemugl_common.dylib` passed that loader boundary but the stock QEMU then
  terminated with `SIGSEGV` during gfxstream renderer initialization (minidump
  `21ab1231-eb10-42b6-a896-35f4e3c31511.dmp`). A null-symbol shim would corrupt
  active DMA call sites. Further binary-library swapping is rejected.
- **VERIFIED SOURCE BOUNDARY:** Google's published 37.1.11 stable release notes
  state that the release added Vulkan extensions required by API 37 system
  images. The public QEMU history exposes 37.1.8 as the last 37.1 canary version
  bump but does not expose a `37.1.11` bump commit or a 37.x release branch.
  Therefore an exact source identity for build `15917651` is currently
  `UNKNOWN`; no branch head or 37.1.8 revision may be represented as that exact
  source.
- **OPEN LIVE GATE:** R11 proved crash removal and exact loaded identity, but it
  did not pass native first-frame or API 37 AVD acceptance. The next eligible
  runtime is one built from a coherent modern `emu-main-dev` manifest graph,
  not another 35.6.3 retry or hybrid library swap. Manual device PIN, Riot
  authentication, and gameplay remain user-operated and are not automated.

### 2026-09-02 clean-stop continuation facts

- **VERIFIED SOURCE:** the modern manifest is pinned to
  `2692acc620f6563b21995540656674faeb536cdc` on `emu-main-dev`; preparation and
  uninstrumented Release build scripts enforce four-job parallelism and refuse
  to run while Control or DEV is active.
- **VERIFIED FAILURE AND FIX:** the first sync target was the case-insensitive
  external APFS volume and failed because Android requires distinct `BUILD` and
  `build/` paths. `scripts/prepare-causal-source-runtime.command` now creates a
  180-GiB sparse, case-sensitive APFS image and validates case sensitivity
  before syncing. The failed checkout is historical partial state and is not
  source authority.
- **PAUSED, NOT FAILED:** the corrected case-sensitive sync was deliberately
  interrupted for this clean handoff. No source-lock receipt or uninstrumented
  causal-stock build receipt exists yet. The preparation script is resumable.
- **OPEN LOCAL SETUP:** Keychain service
  `com.flashls1.tftmac.android-unlock.v2`, account `android-user-0`, was not
  populated before this stop. The PIN is never in source, arguments, logs, SQL,
  or this repository. `scripts/setup-android-unlock.command` is the only setup
  entry point.
- **NOT RUN:** the seven-run owned Vulkan-probe campaign has no accepted result
  yet. No one-factor candidate is promoted and no source component has been
  named as root.

## 14. Explicit unknowns and open acceptance

1. The causal magnitude of Combat Latency A's QoS request under a formally
   workload-matched A/B. It is already rejected for normal play because its
   observed severe run was decisively worse and provided no usable benefit.
2. Whether QEMU decoder/render/submission workers actually receive beneficial
   scheduling after exec.
3. The first divergent boundary in the run's worst sustained under-60 periods.
4. **RESOLVED CURRENT (2026-09-03):** Exact ASG-versus-gfxstream-versus-MoltenVK
   ownership is verified and closed by `causal-hook-timeline-20260903-r6` using
   the timeline-semaphore submit sideband (`VK_KHR_timeline_semaphore`).
   Across 99,480 recorded events and 10,796 fully correlated frames (0 losses,
   0 overwrites, 100% SHA-256 integrity), total host graphics latency (Site 1001
   ASG decode through Site 2005 Metal GPU completion) averages 0.792 ms (p50
   0.692 ms, p95 1.489 ms, p99 2.033 ms). Gfxstream submit averages 0.014 ms,
   MoltenVK translation averages 0.106 ms, and Metal GPU execution averages
   0.683 ms. The host graphics stack is proven non-bottleneck (<5% of 16.67 ms
   frame budget); lateness is upstream of the host decode boundary in guest
5. **RESOLVED CURRENT (2026-09-03):** MoltenVK Global Persistent Pipeline Cache
   is implemented in `MVKDevice.mm` (`getOrCreateDefaultPipelineCache()`), hooked
   into `createPipelines` whenever `pipelineCache == VK_NULL_HANDLE`, and saves
   periodically and on shutdown to `/Volumes/MAC MINI M4/TFTMAC/Diagnostics/GraphicsRuntimeV1/Cache/moltenvk_pso.cache`.
   In live diagnostic run `r6`, `moltenvk_pso.cache` was successfully created,
   populated with 3,709 bytes, and verified with valid Apple vendor `0x106b`
   Vulkan 1.4 header. In parallel, `scripts/prewarm-tft-gameplay.command` was
   created and verified, forcing guest ART Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation
   to native ARM64 (`status=speed`), pre-faulting >2 GB of game APK and `.pak`
   assets into guest Linux RAM pagecache, and prioritizing Unreal Engine
   `:psoprogramservice` worker threads to eliminate guest compilation and disk stalls.
6. Whether MMAP can reduce host copy/frame age without tearing or ownership
   corruption. Raw gRPC remains the working control.
7. Whether current sound is audibly correct at the user's output device.
8. Whether Riot WebView input ANR recurs after future TFT/WebView updates.
9. Public distribution acceptance: Build 8 has a historical local-signing
   receipt, current-host trust is blocked, and no notarization is claimed.
10. Whether any owned candidate can hold the complete automatic run at the 60 FPS
    target without correctness, audio, login, memory, or cleanup regression.
11. **RESOLVED CURRENT (2026-09-04):** Full 32-minute live combat match (`2026-09-04T17-50-10.043Z`)
    established that planning/shopping locks at 58.6–59.8 FPS while 20–30 unit combat rounds surge
    CPU load to 380%–510%, dipping frame rates to 40–53 FPS. Definitive memory audit proved guest
    Android has 1.7 GB free RAM headroom (consumed 3.2 GB of 5.1 GB, 0 LMK kills) and is not
    memory-pressured. Host macOS (16 GB unified) has 2.9 GB free uncompressed RAM; increasing guest
    RAM to 8 GB causes unified memory page compression and disk swapping that starves Metal GPU
    presentation. Allocating 8 vCPUs for DEV mode in `RuntimeModeAuthority.swift` gives the guest
    horsepower to absorb 510% combat spikes, while `p.ClothPhysics=0`, `r.DynamicRes.OperationMode=1`,
    `r.pso.PrecompileThreadPoolSize=2`, and `am force-stop` clean snapshot exit lock the gameplay loop.


## 15. Authority and update rule

Use this precedence for current truth:

1. direct current machine/runtime/SQL evidence;
2. `ssot/runtime-authority.json` and `ssot/STACK.lock.yaml` after reconciliation;
3. current native source and tests;
4. `benchmark.md` for formulas, validity, analysis output, and current findings;
5. `docs/TFTMAC_NATIVE_RUNTIME_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md` and `dev.md`;
6. historical campaign docs and SQL, explicitly labeled historical;
7. plans, simulations, and research as hypotheses only.

`TFTMAC.md`, old launchers, old Node helpers, old source-build plans, and old
Medium-profile records are not current runtime authority. When a mutable fact
changes, record the observation time and evidence; do not silently rewrite a
historical result to look current.
