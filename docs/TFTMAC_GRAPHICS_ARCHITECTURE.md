# TFTMAC Graphics Architecture

## Win condition

TFTMAC must provide the best practical Teamfight Tactics experience on Apple-silicon Macs while preserving a clean trust boundary:

- Riot's game binary remains official and unmodified whenever possible.
- Google Play remains the live-client acquisition/update authority.
- Engine-specific graphics changes are isolated behind explicit runtime adapters.
- A working live path must never be broken by experimental Unreal tuning.

## Runtime model

TFTMAC uses a two-layer architecture:

1. **Engine-neutral Mac shell**
   - owns the native SwiftUI launcher;
   - owns Android emulator lifecycle;
   - owns display size, DPI, CPU/RAM, window behavior, input, audio and local diagnostics;
   - detects the active Riot engine/runtime;
   - exposes safe graphics presets.

2. **Engine adapter**
   - `LiveNativeAdapter`: current Google Play live client, stock Riot runtime;
   - `UnrealEnhancedAdapter`: future/live Unreal client, harvesting the proven Mactician PBE renderer work;
   - adapters are selected by evidence, never by version-string guesswork.

## Engine detection

Evidence is evaluated in order:

1. resolved Android launch activity;
2. package/native-library inventory;
3. running-process mappings when accessible;
4. SurfaceFlinger layer/activity evidence;
5. app-managed patch/runtime files when observable;
6. Unreal markers such as `libUnreal.so`, `UECommandLine.txt`, `UnrealGame`, `DeviceProfiles.ini`, or Unreal-specific log output.

Current live evidence after the completed in-game patch:

- package: `com.riotgames.league.teamfighttactics`
- launch activity: `com.riotgames.leagueoflegends.RiotNativeActivity`
- Google Play package version: `16.16.8042660`
- base APK SHA-256: `9ed691e1b7e976394cc0dd91c0717df954429320a323e751e4848f6214c34919`
- native payload includes `libleagueoflegends.so`
- no `libUnreal.so` or `assets/UECommandLine.txt` in the Play Store base APK
- post-patch process/storage inspection found no Unreal runtime evidence
- the current live client therefore remains on Riot's native Android runtime for this build

The Unreal adapter remains prepared from Mactician donor work and must activate only when future live runtime evidence proves the engine transition.

## Graphics presets

Graphics presets are engine-neutral and map to display geometry plus resource allocation.

| Preset | Framebuffer | DPI | Intent |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| **Enhanced 1080p** | **1920×1080** | **280** | **Primary target; 617dp tablet-class short side** |
| 1440p | 2560×1440 | 416 | Experimental only |
| 1800p | 3200×1800 | 520 | Experimental only |
| 4K | 3840×2160 | 640 | Experimental only |

The launcher applies both emulator geometry and guest `wm size` / `wm density` so Android layout and the host window agree. TFTMAC deliberately targets 1080p rather than using supersampled resolution as a substitute for renderer quality. GPU budget should be spent first on anti-aliasing, texture filtering, stable frame pacing, shader behavior and renderer quality.

## LiveNativeAdapter

The current safe path uses:

- official Google Play system image;
- Apple-silicon ARM64 Android emulator;
- `-gpu host`;
- Riot's untouched package;
- no APK overlay;
- no root requirement;
- normal Google Play and Riot authentication.

Safe enhancement surface:

- resolution and DPI;
- host GPU mode;
- guest CPU and memory;
- window sizing/fullscreen;
- input mapping;
- audio handling;
- emulator transport flags proven not to alter Riot code;
- frame pacing measurement.

## UnrealEnhancedAdapter

When live TFT exposes the Unreal runtime, harvest Mactician's proven PBE work rather than rediscovering it.

Candidate stack:

`Unreal -> OpenGL ES / ANGLE -> gfxstream -> Metal`

or where supported:

`Unreal -> Vulkan -> gfxstream / MoltenVK -> Metal`

Donor capabilities already present in this repository include:

- `run-tft-root-affinity.command`;
- `run-tft-angle-opengl.command`;
- `run-tft-best-verified.command`;
- temporary verified APK overlay support;
- `DeviceProfiles.ini` injection with rollback;
- `UECommandLine.txt` overlay preparation;
- MoltenVK queue and fast-math tuning;
- ANGLE feature controls;
- ASG transport tuning;
- frame-pacing and input-latency instrumentation;
- 1080p/1440p/1800p/4K profiles.

The adapter must only activate when the running live build proves the expected Unreal artifact/layout. A hash/version/layout mismatch must fall back to `LiveNativeAdapter`, not attempt a stale overlay.

## Future enhancement ladder

### Tier 1 — safe/live now

- Enhanced 1080p target at 1920×1080 / 280 DPI (617dp tablet class);
- 8 vCPU / 8 GB guest RAM on the validated Mac Mini profile;
- host GPU acceleration;
- OpenGL ES 3.2 capability (`196610`);
- ANGLE EGL with Vulkan 1.3 on Apple M4;
- native fullscreen/window fill;
- FPS overlay and frame-time diagnostics.

### Tier 2 — Unreal enhanced

- verified ANGLE/OpenGL path;
- guest DeviceProfiles tuning;
- anisotropic filtering and anti-aliasing profiles;
- shader/prewarm experiments;
- asynchronous MoltenVK queue submission where validated;
- bounded Metal command-buffer tuning;
- ASG transport tuning.

### Tier 3 — measured quality optimizer

TFTMAC should benchmark candidate profiles instead of assuming "higher" means "better". Score each profile on:

- median FPS;
- p95/p99 frame time;
- janky frames;
- input latency;
- visual resolution;
- crash-free session duration;
- host CPU/GPU pressure.

The winning profile is the highest visual-quality configuration that remains inside an explicit frame-pacing envelope.

## Non-goals

- modifying Riot gameplay logic;
- bypassing Riot authentication or anti-cheat;
- intercepting Riot credentials;
- embedding third-party or mirrored Riot APKs in Git;
- blindly applying PBE hashes/configuration to live builds;
- claiming an Unreal profile is valid without runtime evidence.

## Acceptance gates

### Current live gate

- official Google Play installer authority confirmed;
- live TFT starts from TFTMAC;
- Riot login works;
- a full live match can be entered and completed;
- no Riot binary modification is required.

### Unreal-enhanced gate

- post-patch live client proves Unreal runtime/layout;
- donor overlay/profile assumptions are revalidated against the exact live build;
- graphics adapter is reversible and hash-gated;
- quality profile materially improves visual quality without unacceptable frame pacing;
- fallback to stock live remains one click away.
