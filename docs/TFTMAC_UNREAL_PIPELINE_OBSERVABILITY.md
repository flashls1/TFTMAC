# TFTMAC Unreal graphics observability and patch map

Authority date: 2026-08-31

## Fixed premise and engineering objective

TFT uses Epic's Unreal Engine technology. Fortnite and other shipped Unreal
Android titles are therefore valid architecture and experiment references. The
reference does not make every TFT runtime choice identical: the exact Unreal
branch, RHI, renderer features, shader keys, PSO cache, swapchain, device
profile, and CVars must be identified from this TFT run before a connector is
changed.

The absence of Riot's signed game source changes the interception point. It
does not make the graphics pipeline unknowable. TFTMAC can observe and change
the components it owns: the Android/emulator configuration, AEMU/gfxstream,
ANGLE when active, MoltenVK when active, the native frame transport, and the
final Metal presenter. A future source-built gfxstream can add a shared
`frame_id` at every guest/host handoff without modifying Riot's APK.

## Transferable Unreal model

The useful Unreal reference pipeline is:

```text
GameThread simulation
  -> RenderThread command construction
  -> optional RHIThread / graphics API submission
  -> guest GPU queue and swapchain
  -> Android compositor actual presentation
```

Unreal Insights can name GameThread, RenderThread, RHIThread, GPU and PSO work
when the application build exposes those trace channels. TFTMAC must leave
those internal spans `UNKNOWN` when the signed TFT build does not expose them.
Android platform traces still establish CPU scheduling, compositor deadlines,
GPU memory, and what the player actually saw.

## Runtime paths that evidence must distinguish

Only a per-session pipeline snapshot may promote one of these candidates:

1. Unreal Vulkan -> guest Vulkan -> gfxstream -> host Vulkan -> MoltenVK -> Metal.
2. Unreal GLES/EGL -> ANGLE Vulkan -> gfxstream -> host Vulkan -> MoltenVK -> Metal.
3. Unreal GLES/EGL -> native guest GLES -> gfxstream -> host rendering.
4. Another renderer selected by the installed TFT/emulator build.

ANGLE applies only when the game selected a GLES/EGL path and Android selected
ANGLE for that package. MoltenVK applies only when the host Vulkan backend
actually loaded it. Requested launch flags are hypotheses; normal runtime log
identity and effective guest properties are evidence.

## Three clocks that must never be merged

| Label | Measurement | Valid claim |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TFT` | Exact TFT `GameActivity` BLAST SurfaceView, SurfaceFlinger actual-present timestamps | Frames the guest compositor actually presented for TFT |
| `PIPE` | Authenticated EmulatorController image arrivals plus sampled content identity | Transport delivery and whether delivered images changed |
| `MAC` | TFTMAC's final Metal command completion and presentation loop | Health of the native Mac presentation of an already completed Android image |

`PIPE 60` and `MAC 60` can coexist with a frozen or repeatedly presented TFT
frame. Neither is Unreal FPS. The overlay must show `TFT —` when the exact
SurfaceView cannot be selected or its timestamps cannot be read; it must never
substitute another clock.

## Implemented data contract

Every native app start creates a private SQLite session. The 2.3 telemetry
extension adds:

| Table | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| `game_frame_intervals` | Every newly observed actual-present interval, direct active stack SHA, frame-window link, jank flag, severe flag and missed-vsync equivalent |
| `game_frame_windows` | One-second TFT FPS, direct active stack SHA, 1% low, p50/p95/p99/max, jank, severe stalls, missed vsyncs, layer identity, refresh period and explicit availability reason |
| `stream_freshness_windows` | Changed/identical sampled content, longest identical run and sequence loss |
| `host_presentation_windows` | Final Metal submissions/completions, unique/repeated sources, drawable/command errors, completion and GPU timing |
| `pipeline_log_aggregates` | Counts of real warning/error/stall lines at gfxstream, ASG, Vulkan, MoltenVK, shader and fence boundaries; normal configuration lines do not become failures |
| `graphics_runs` | Automatic TFT process/layer lifetime, start/end reason, configuration SHA, target FPS and exact-layer receipt |
| `graphics_pipeline_snapshots` | Per-snapshot stack receipt, canonical receipt JSON/SHA-256, completeness/unknown fields, and observed active-path identity |
| `graphics_pipeline_incidents` | Automatic exact-layer degradation window, admitted trace link, first observed boundary, and explicit causal unknowns |
| `diagnostic_artifacts` | SHA-256, byte count, trigger and analysis state for bounded Perfetto captures |
| `host_resource_samples` | Host available/compressed/swap/pageouts, thermal state and power source at five seconds |
| `combat_benchmarks` | Named preset, configuration SHA, 300/480-second boundaries, coverage, validity and summary metrics |
| `combat_incidents` | Optional controlled-A/B visible-stutter/benchmark evidence; not the authority for base graphics logging |
| `combat_comparisons` | Control/candidate deltas and deterministic HOME_RUN/PROMISING/REJECT/INCONCLUSIVE result |

SurfaceFlinger history polls overlap. The collector establishes a first-poll
boundary, de-duplicates actual-present timestamps, resets on layer replacement,
and records bounded-history loss explicitly rather than inventing one giant
frame interval. Interval inserts are committed once per poll so the logger does
not create dozens of disk transactions per second.

The logger begins automatically with the observed TFT process/layer lifecycle
and remains active until process/app close. It does not require a user marker,
battle classifier, or Combat Benchmark. The fixed Combat Benchmark remains an
optional controlled A/B path with one 20-second/32-MiB start trace and up to two
15-second/32-MiB incident traces. Automatic graphics incidents require an
observed TFT process, exact active layer, two adjacent bad one-second windows,
and, outside a controlled A/B, a separate graphics-run budget/cooldown. During
an active A/B the start trace and automatic/manual incidents share that
benchmark's fixed three-trace ceiling. Traces
include SurfaceFlinger, FrameTimeline, layers, Android GPU memory, scheduler
switch/wakeup/waking events, process/system stats, TFT process identity and
guest CPU-frequency events when exposed. Every retained trace is hash-sealed
and normalized immediately with pinned Perfetto `trace_processor_shell` v58.2;
normalization output and hashes are written to SQL. Failure deletes the
unprocessed raw trace and records a trace failure.

`graphics_runs`, stack-receipt SHA-256s, and frame-window joins are implemented
in the current source worktree but require a new capture to become runtime
verified. They establish lifecycle and observation integrity, not a causal owner.

## Attribution gates

| Candidate blocker | Evidence required before naming it |
| --- | --- |
| Guest display/frame pacing | TFT actual-present misses or long intervals, with bounded SurfaceFlinger/FrameTimeline evidence |
| Unreal CPU thread | A missed frame correlated with named Unreal spans, or at minimum TFT process runnable/running pressure; without named spans report only process CPU pressure |
| gfxstream/ASG transport | Queue depth or submit-to-host receive time from an instrumented gfxstream build; warning counts alone are not latency proof |
| Host emulator GPU | Host renderer command completion crossing display deadlines plus supported Metal/GPU counters |
| PSO/shader hitch | A PSO compile/miss event coincident with the hitch in a controlled UE trace; a fight-only spike is not sufficient |
| ANGLE mismatch | A session snapshot proves ANGLE is active and a one-factor controlled change improves actual-present percentiles without a correctness regression |
| MoltenVK behavior | A snapshot proves MoltenVK is active and its own queue/pipeline-cache instrumentation or a controlled build isolates the change |
| TFTMAC final presenter | Guest `TFT` stays healthy while `MAC` completion, GPU time, drawable misses or repeated presentations regress |

The conservative weakest-boundary view may report only the first observed
unhealthy/missing receipt among `TFT`, `PIPE`, and `MAC`; it must never turn a
time-adjacent warning, CPU/RAM/audio health sample, or incomplete stack receipt
into a graphics causal claim. CPU/RAM/audio remain correctness and health
context, outside the graphics-only optimization equation.

## Safe code and configuration intervention points

1. Native logger/controller: markers, clock alignment, capture health, loss
   counters, SurfaceFlinger timing and Perfetto lifecycle. This is implemented.
2. **Planned, gated next layer:** source-built gfxstream/AEMU may emit one monotonic frame ID and timestamps at
   guest submit, host receive, host queue, host GPU scheduled/completed and
   output present. It is eligible only after the automatic graphics runs and
   conservative joins leave a real guest/host queue gap unresolved.
3. ANGLE source/build, only if active: log renderer/feature selection, shader
   translation/cache time, queue waits and relevant extension negotiation.
4. MoltenVK source/build, only if active: log pipeline creation/cache hits,
   queue submit, command-buffer scheduling/completion and swapchain behavior.
5. TFTMAC's final Metal presenter: change copy/storage/scheduling only when the
   `MAC` layer, not the guest layer, is the first failing boundary.
6. A controlled Unreal Android reference app on the identical emulator stack:
   expose Unreal Insights and systematic PSO/frame-pacing experiments. It
   proves stack capability and causal signatures, not TFT internals by proxy.

Do not patch the signed TFT APK, inject code into Riot's process, copy
Fortnite's PSO cache, or label a guessed shader as Riot's. Unreal/Fortnite
practices remain valuable as test hypotheses: PSO precaching, work off the
interactive frame, stable Android frame pacing, device-profile quality tiers,
and one-factor RHI experiments.

## Combat experiment protocol

1. Run the locked `control` preset at High / 60 FPS / Performance Mode OFF for a representative 5-8 minute heavy-combat window.
2. Restart with `combat_latency_a`, keep the same TFT settings, and repeat a comparable window.
3. Mark every visible stutter; the run ends manually after five minutes or automatically at eight minutes.
4. Compare the 5 seconds before and after each marker: TFT actual-present p95,
   p99, max, 1% low, consecutive misses, stream freshness, Mac presenter, CPU,
   memory, thermal/frequency evidence available in the trace, and pipeline
   errors.
5. Classify the first divergent boundary; leave later boundaries as effects.
6. If Combat Latency A wins, run the five-minute cold confirmation before promotion.
7. Repeat a comparable fight and a cold-start confirmation. Reject correctness,
   boot, ADB, audio, memory, login, or usability regressions.
8. Use the automatic trace-active/trace-inactive comparison; over 5% change marks causal trace conclusions `OBSERVER_OVERHEAD_INVALID` while retaining performance data.

## Current unknowns to close with data

- Exact TFT Unreal branch and mobile renderer feature set.
- Active per-run RHI and all negotiated graphics extensions/features.
- Game/Render/RHI thread spans when the signed build does not expose them.
- TFT shader/PSO keys, cache hit rate and compile timing.
- gfxstream queue depth and per-frame guest-submit-to-host-receive latency.
- MoltenVK pipeline-cache and queue timing inside the emulator process.
- Host Metal saturation counters for the emulator renderer, distinct from the
  final TFTMAC presenter.
- Observer overhead during a comparable major fight.

An unknown is not filled by a Fortnite assumption. Fortnite/Unreal tells us
which mechanism and signature to test; the correlated TFT run tells us whether
that mechanism is active and failing here.
